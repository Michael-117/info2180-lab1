 <h2>Michael Pearson</h2>
 <p>I am in the process of reading for my degree in Electronics and Computer Science. I have completed courses involving Physics, Renewable Energy Systems Design, Electronic Systems Engineering, and Computer Sciences. Much of my background involves programming in languages such as: Python, JavaScript, AVR C, C++, Java, Perl and Bash. These courses have imparted me with skills and experience involving design and implementation of renewable energy systems, robotics and embedded systems development geared towards solving real worldproblems, data science-oriented modelling techniques and the training of artificial neural
    networks for tasks such as image recognition. Applying these skillsets requires human-computer interactions, and so my interest in Web Development stems from my inexperience in designing attractive but functional web based interfaces.</p>
